## Education
**Sun Yat-sen University B.E. · MA.Eng in Computer Science 2019/09 - 2026/06 (expected)**
- Supervised by X. Zhang, interested in **compiler** and **Machine Learning**.

## Research
**VecTrans: LLM Transformation Framework for Better Auto-vectorization on High-performance CPU**
Z. Zheng, L. Cheng, L. Li, R. Rocha, T. Liu, W. Wei, X. Zhang, Y. Gao. LCTES'25 submitted
- VecTrans leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization.
- VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compiler's auto-vectorization.
**mLOOP: Optimize Loop Unrolling in Compilation with a ML-based Approach**
Z. Zheng, Y. Wu, X. Zhang. GitHub. NAS'24
- mLOOP employs the XGBoost model to predict loop unroll factors.
- mLOOP is implemented as an LLVM optimization pass, enabling seamless deployment within existing compiler pipelines.
**GoPTX: Fine-grained GPU Kernel Fusion by PTX-level Instruction Weaving**
K. Wu, Z. Lin, X. Meng, Z. Zheng, W. Pan, X. Zhang, Y. Lu. GitHub. DAC'25
**REFIT: Improve Code Efficiency via Binary Level Loop Optimization**
T. Zhang, G. Chen, W. Pan, Z. Zheng, G. Sun and X. Zhang. ICCCS'25

## Research Interest
**Compiler Optimizations & ML-Augmented Code Generation**
- Focus on synergistic techniques between compiler optimizations (e.g., **loop unrolling, vectorization**) and machine learning, enhancing performance in HPC and edge computing.
- Future work: **Repository-level code optimization** (cross-procedural/inter-file analysis) and **scalable parallel code generation** for heterogeneous architectures (CPU/GPU/TPU).

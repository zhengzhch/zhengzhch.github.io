title: "VecTrans: LLM Transformation Framework for Better Auto-vectorization on High-performance CPU"
collection: submitted
category: conferences 
permalink: /publication/VecTrans
excerpt: "VecTrans leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. And it first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compiler's auto-vectorization."
